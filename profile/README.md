# Welcome to The Geomagnetic Storm Analytics Organization!
## Objective & Purposes
The main idea behind this organization is to house personal projects (or through on-campus research, as well as internships/co-ops). It will contain projects of all sorts that surround the analysis of geomagnetic storm and the Earth's atmosphere. There are no specifics to the layer of Earth's atmosphere, or the specific phenomena that occurs in our atmosphere.

## Current Projects
- Data analysis pipeline for SWMF data
